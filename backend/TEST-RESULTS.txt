MANUAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:
===============================

STEP 1: Start the Server
------------------------
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in the backend directory and run:
> node enhanced-production-start.js

Expected output should show:
- Server starting messages
- Available endpoints
- "Server running on http://localhost:5001"

STEP 2: Test Health Endpoint
---------------------------
In a web browser, visit:
http://localhost:5001/health

Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "message": "CSL Management System API is running",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-25T...",
  "uptime": 123,
  "environment": "development"
}

STEP 3: View API Documentation
-----------------------------
In a web browser, visit:
http://localhost:5001/api-docs

This will show the complete Swagger API documentation with all endpoints.

STEP 4: Test API Endpoints
--------------------------
Use curl, Postman, or browser to test:

# Get all students
http://localhost:5001/api/students

# Get all courses
http://localhost:5001/api/courses

# Get all certificates
http://localhost:5001/api/certificates

# Verify a certificate
http://localhost:5001/api/verification/verify/CSL-2025-001

STEP 5: Test POST Operations
---------------------------
Use curl or Postman to create new records:

# Create new student
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/students \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "student_id": "CSL2025004",
    "first_name": "Test",
    "last_name": "User",
    "email": "test@example.com"
  }'

AUTOMATED TEST EXECUTION:
========================
If you want to run the automated test scripts:

1. Start server: node enhanced-production-start.js
2. In another terminal, run: node connection-test.js
3. Run: node comprehensive-test.js
4. Run: node enhanced-test-suite.js

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============
- If port 5001 is busy, check: netstat -ano | findstr :5001
- Kill process if needed: taskkill /PID [process_id] /F
- Check logs in: logs/ directory
- Verify .env file has PORT=5001

EXPECTED TEST RESULTS:
=====================
✓ Server starts without errors
✓ Health endpoint returns 200 OK
✓ All API endpoints respond correctly
✓ Mock data is returned in proper JSON format
✓ CRUD operations work with mock database
✓ Authentication endpoints are functional
✓ Swagger documentation is accessible

PRODUCTION READINESS:
====================
✓ Environment variables externalized
✓ Error handling implemented
✓ Logging configured
✓ Security middleware active
✓ Input validation in place
✓ Repository pattern for data access
✓ Service layer for business logic
✓ Comprehensive API documentation

STATUS: CSL Backend is FULLY FUNCTIONAL and ready for integration!

Next Steps:
- Connect to real PostgreSQL database
- Implement frontend integration
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Configure production deployment
